WKTravertine
=========

Travertine is Waterfall with additional protocols. Waterfall is a fork of the well-known [BungeeCord](https://github.com/SpigotMC/BungeeCord) server teleportation suite.

WKTravertine is Travertine with antibot, authlogin, skinssystem, fix exploit, anticrash, antivpn and more more 

Waterfall focuses on three main areas:

* **Stability**: Waterfall aims to be stable. We will achieve this through making the code base testable and discouraging practices that lead to proxy lag.
* **Features**: Waterfall aims to include more features than canonical BungeeCord.
* **Scalability**: Waterfall should be able to handle a large number of concurrent players, given a reasonably modern CPU, memory, and good network connection.

Travertine focuses on one main area:

* **Additional Client Version Support**: Travertine aims to support client versions older then what is supported in upstream. This includes 1.7 support. Additionally Travertine may release Snapshot and PRE Client support patches as time permits.

## Why fork Waterfall?

Travertine has a goal of adding additional protocol versions.

Travertine was forked because of the fact that Waterfall intends to only support protocol versions supported by upstream BungeeCord. 

Travertine will track upstream Waterfall and merge changes as needed.
